# Broadcast one message to several Herdr agents, then collect each reply.
#
# Sends to EVERY target first (fast), then waits on all of them CONCURRENTLY.
# Wall-clock is the slowest single agent, not the sum.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/broadcast.sh "message" target1 target2 [target3 ...]
#
# Targets: agent names (reviewer) or pane ids (w26:p4)
#
# Options (env vars):
#   HAC_TIMEOUT       per-agent wait timeout in seconds (default: 180)
#   HAC_LINES         transcript lines used for baseline + reply (default: 60)
#   HAC_WAIT_ARGS     extra args passed to wait_for_idle.py (e.g. "--full")
#
# Exit 0 if all agents settled idle/done; otherwise 1.
