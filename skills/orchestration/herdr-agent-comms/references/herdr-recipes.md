# Herdr recipes for agent fleets

Read this when you need layout variants, multi-line sends, human steer/focus, scrollback recovery, or troubleshooting.

## Default fleet layout (this skill)

**Root + sub-agents as equal-width columns in one tab:**

```
Session (default)
└── Workspace: <project>
    └── Tab: <root's tab>                          ← single row of columns
        ┌───────────┬───────────┬───────────┐
        │ root (you)│ reviewer  │ tests      │
        └───────────┴───────────┴───────────┘
```

(`next_grid_split.py` always targets the current rightmost column for the
split, then its `--equalize` pass re-converges every column to the same
width no matter how many are spawned — never a wide root next to narrow
workers, or vice versa. Columns end equal within ~1 terminal cell.)

Why this default: the human sees the **root agent and every sub-agent at the
same size**; the orchestrator is never displaced into a side tab or left
oddly wide/narrow; sidebar still rolls status per workspace.

### Spawn N sub-agents into an equal-width grid

Use `scripts/next_grid_split.py` for every spawn: the default run emits the
split line targeting the **current rightmost column** (`--ratio 1/N`, so the
new right pane lands on the `1/N` equal target — see "Split ratio" below),
and `--equalize` runs the live iterative equalizer that re-converges every
column (including root) to the same width. `--equalize` is a **hard gate**:
it exits non-zero on a resize failure or non-convergence, and the spawn
helper below aborts rather than launch a worker into an uneven layout.

```bash
root_pane="${HERDR_PANE_ID:?}"
root_tab="${HERDR_TAB_ID:?}"
ws="${HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID:?}"
project_dir=$(pwd)
# Resolve scripts/ by probing known install locations. Don't derive from
# $0/BASH_SOURCE here — unreliable when an agent runs this inline rather
# than as a saved script file. Repo-local copies win over global installs
# so a pinned repo checkout isn't silently overridden by whatever version
# happens to be installed globally.

### Grid heuristics

| Step | Rule |
|---|---|
| Target pane | current rightmost column (`rect.x` order) |
| Direction | always `right` — one row of columns, never `down` |
| Split ratio | `1/N` (the planner emits it) — `--ratio R` is the existing/left child's share, so the new right pane gets `1-R = (N-1)/N` of the split column = the `1/N` equal target of the tab |
| After each spawn | run `--equalize` — a split alone can't shrink the pre-existing columns |
| Re-run per spawn | never hardcode a fixed ratio — it shrinks every time |
| Focus | always `--no-focus` |

```bash
# $here from the resolver above (or re-probe if starting fresh in this shell)
python3 "$here/next_grid_split.py" --equalize --root-pane "$root_pane"
herdr pane layout --pane "$root_pane"   # verify near-equal-width rects
```

Manual fallback without the helper: read `herdr pane layout`, order panes by `rect.x`, split the rightmost one `right`, then hand-run the equalizer — see "Equal-width columns — verified semantics" below.

### Prefer grid split over `agent start`

| Command | When |
|---|---|
| `next_grid_split.py` split + `--equalize` … `--no-focus` | **Default** — equal-width grid including root |
| `herdr agent start name --tab "$root_tab" --split right --no-focus -- …` | OK if you only care about same tab; leaves unequal widths unless you run `--equalize` afterward |

### Equal-width columns — verified semantics

These were confirmed **live against herdr 0.7.4**; the CLI has no `--help`, so
run experiments in a throwaway `herdr tab create` and read `herdr pane layout`
before/after (close the probe tab when done — never probe the session's own
tab). Results:

- **`pane split <p> --direction right --ratio R`** — `R` is the fraction the
  **existing (left) child** keeps of the pane `p`; the new (right) pane gets
  `1 - R`. It resizes only `p`; the other columns are untouched. So a single
  split can never equalize `N >= 3` columns. (`--ratio 0.5` on a 210-cell tab
  → 105/105.) To add column N we split the rightmost column at **`R = 1/N`**:
  when the N-1 existing columns are equal, the rightmost is `1/(N-1)` of the
  tab, so the new pane's `(1-R) = (N-1)/N` share of it equals `1/N` of the
  whole tab — the equal target. Verified live: from 105/105, splitting the
  rightmost at `--ratio 0.333` (=1/3) gives a new pane of 70 (= 210/3), i.e.
  the equal target — NOT 35, which is what the earlier inverted `(N-1)/N`
  value produced. The equalizer then fixes the disturbed inner columns.
- **`pane resize --pane P --direction D --amount A`** — `A` is a **delta**, a
  fraction of the whole tab area width (`A * area_width` cells), *not* an
  absolute target width. `--direction D` moves the edge on side `D`: a pane
  with a neighbor on side `D` **grows** toward it; against a wall it shrinks.
  The freed/absorbed cells redistribute **proportionally** among the panes on
  the far side of the moved boundary. (Verified: a leftmost pane resized
  `left 0.1` on a 210 tab shrank by exactly 21 cells, distributed to its
  right neighbors by their prior widths.)
- **Consequence:** one left-to-right resize sweep does not land equal (each
  resize perturbs downstream columns), but the sweep is a *contraction* —
  iterating it converges. Observed 4-column decay: spread 25 → 13 → 5 → 3 → 1.

**Equalizer algorithm** (`next_grid_split.py --equalize`): compute equal
integer targets summing to `area_width` (remainder onto the leftmost
columns); each pass, sweep internal boundaries left to right and move each
toward its target cumulative position by **growing the neighbor-bearing pane**
(boundary must move right → `resize left_col right`; must move left →
`resize right_col left`), re-reading the layout after every resize; repeat
until the width spread is ≤1 cell (cap 12 passes). Verified end-to-end via the
script: 2 cols → 105/105, 3 → 70/70/70, 4 → 53/53/52/52, 5 → 42×5. A failed
`herdr pane resize` (nonzero exit) or non-convergence within the pass cap is a
**hard error**: `--equalize` exits non-zero with an actionable message naming
the pane/direction/amount (or the final widths), and the spawn recipes abort
instead of launching a worker into an uneven layout.

**Manual equalize** (helper unavailable): for a tab of width `W` with `N`
columns, target each column ≈ `W/N`. Repeat this sweep until widths stop
changing: for each internal boundary `i` (left to right), if the cumulative
width left of it is below `(i+1)*W/N`, `herdr pane resize --pane <col i>
--direction right --amount <deficit/W>`; if above, `herdr pane resize --pane
<col i+1> --direction left --amount <excess/W>`. Because widths are whole
cells, columns end equal within ±1 cell (exact only when `W` divides by `N`).

### When to use tab-per-agent instead

- User asks for "full screen per agent" / "own tab each"
- Agent TUIs need a wide viewport (diff-heavy review)
- More agents than fit usefully in one tile (~5+)

```bash
for name in reviewer tests docs; do
  j=$(herdr tab create --workspace "$ws" --cwd "$project_dir" --label "$name" --no-focus)
  pane=$(printf '%s' "$j" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["root_pane"]["pane_id"])')
  herdr pane rename "$pane" "$name"
  herdr agent rename "$pane" "$name"
  herdr pane run "$pane" "pi --thinking medium"
done
```

### Adding a log / shell pane into the grid

```bash
# $here from the resolver above (or re-probe if starting fresh in this shell)
plan=$(python3 "$here/next_grid_split.py" --root-pane "$root_pane") || { echo "Error: split planning failed." >&2; exit 1; }
read -r _ split_from _ _ ratio < <(head -1 <<<"$plan")
[ -n "$split_from" ] && [ -n "$ratio" ] || { echo "Error: empty split plan." >&2; exit 1; }
j=$(herdr pane split "$split_from" --direction right --ratio "$ratio" --cwd "$project_dir" --no-focus) || { echo "Error: pane split failed." >&2; exit 1; }
pane=$(printf '%s' "$j" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); r=d["result"]; print((r.get("pane") or r)["pane_id"])') || { echo "Error: could not parse pane id." >&2; exit 1; }
[ -n "$pane" ] || { echo "Error: empty pane id." >&2; exit 1; }
# Equalize all columns — HARD GATE: abort (and close the orphan pane) rather
# than run the log tail into an uneven layout.
if ! python3 "$here/next_grid_split.py" --equalize --root-pane "$root_pane"; then
  echo "Error: equalize failed; not launching log pane. Orphan: $pane (herdr pane close $pane to undo)." >&2
  herdr pane close "$pane" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  exit 1
fi
herdr pane rename "$pane" logs || { echo "Error: rename failed; orphan $pane." >&2; exit 1; }
herdr pane run "$pane" "bash -lc 'tail -f /tmp/app.log'" || { echo "Error: launch failed; orphan $pane." >&2; exit 1; }
```

## Sending multi-line or code-heavy messages

`herdr pane run <pane> <command>` takes one shell-quoted string. Nested quotes and newlines break easily. Each pattern is **self-contained**: it resolves `$here` (the skill's `scripts/` dir) executably, **preflights before the first pane mutation** (so a working/blocked pane is never touched), guards every text-delivery step, then **preflights AGAIN immediately before the guarded Enter** (the pane could have flipped `blocked` in between). Resolve `$here` once first:

```bash
here=""
for cand in "skills/herdr-agent-comms/scripts" ".agents/skills/herdr-agent-comms/scripts" \
  ".claude/skills/herdr-agent-comms/scripts" "$HOME/.claude/skills/herdr-agent-comms/scripts" \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/herdr-agent-comms/scripts"; do
  [ -f "$cand/preflight_send.py" ] && { here="$cand"; break; }
done
[ -n "$here" ] || { echo "Error: preflight_send.py not found in any known install location" >&2; exit 1; }
```

**Pattern A — short instruction that reads a file:**

```bash
task_file=$(mktemp)
cat >"$task_file" <<'EOF'
Review these files:
- src/a.ts
- src/b.ts

Return only:
1. bugs
2. missing tests
EOF
# One atomic mutation (`pane run` submits + Enter): a single preflight before it.
python3 "$here/preflight_send.py" "$pane_id" >/dev/null \
  || { echo "Error: $pane_id not safe to send to (preflight failed) — see stderr" >&2; rm -f "$task_file"; exit 1; }
herdr pane run "$pane_id" "Read $task_file and follow its instructions. Delete the file when done." \
  || { echo "send failed for $pane_id" >&2; rm -f "$task_file"; exit 1; }
```

**Pattern B — `send-text` then Enter** (when you must avoid shell expansion inside `pane run`):

```bash
# Preflight BEFORE the first mutation — send-text alters the pane, so a
# working/blocked pane must be rejected before any text is injected.
python3 "$here/preflight_send.py" "$pane_id" >/dev/null \
  || { echo "Error: $pane_id not safe to send to (preflight failed) — see stderr" >&2; exit 1; }
# Guard send-text: if the text never landed, DO NOT fall through to the Enter.
herdr pane send-text "$pane_id" "line one" \
  || { echo "send-text failed for $pane_id — not submitting Enter" >&2; exit 1; }
# Preflight AGAIN immediately before the Enter (the pane may have flipped
# `blocked` since the text landed — a bare Enter would answer that dialog).
python3 "$here/preflight_send.py" "$pane_id" >/dev/null \
  || { echo "Error: $pane_id not safe to submit (preflight failed) — see stderr" >&2; exit 1; }
herdr pane send-keys "$pane_id" enter \
  || { echo "Enter failed for $pane_id" >&2; exit 1; }
```

**Pattern C — agent name:** resolve the name to **one** pane id first, then drive that **exact** id for the preflight, the text delivery, and the Enter. Never preflight/Enter a `$pane_id` while delivering text to a bare name — a stale/mismatched id would mutate one pane and submit into another.

```bash
# Resolve the agent NAME to a single pane id, then pin every step to it.
pane_id="$(herdr agent get reviewer 2>/dev/null | python3 -c '
import sys, json
try:
    d = json.load(sys.stdin)
    a = d.get("result", {}).get("agent") or d.get("result", {})
    pid = a.get("pane_id")
except Exception:
    pid = None
print(pid or "", end="")')"
[ -n "$pane_id" ] || { echo "Error: could not resolve agent 'reviewer' to a pane id" >&2; exit 1; }
# Preflight BEFORE the first mutation — send-text injects into THIS pane.
python3 "$here/preflight_send.py" "$pane_id" >/dev/null \
  || { echo "Error: $pane_id not safe to send to (preflight failed) — see stderr" >&2; exit 1; }
# Deliver text to the resolved pane id (not the bare name), guarded.
herdr pane send-text "$pane_id" "summarize src/" \
  || { echo "send-text failed for $pane_id — not submitting Enter" >&2; exit 1; }
# Preflight AGAIN immediately before the submitting Enter (same pane id).
python3 "$here/preflight_send.py" "$pane_id" >/dev/null \
  || { echo "Error: $pane_id not safe to submit (preflight failed) — see stderr" >&2; exit 1; }
herdr pane send-keys "$pane_id" enter \
  || { echo "Enter failed for $pane_id" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Remember: `agent send` does **not** append Enter; `pane run` does.

## Human steer / focus

| Goal | Command |
|---|---|
| Stay on whole board | already one tab (root + subs) |
| Jump UI to one sub-agent | `herdr agent focus reviewer` |
| Jump back toward root | click root pane / focus root pane id |
| Attach/takeover terminal | `herdr agent attach reviewer` (optional `--takeover`) |
| Read without stealing focus | `herdr agent read reviewer --source recent-unwrapped --lines 80` |

Orchestrator rule: use `--no-focus` on every split/start so fleet spawn doesn't yank focus off the root agent. Focus a sub-agent only when the human wants to type or dismiss a `blocked` dialog.

Detach Herdr client (leave agents running): `prefix+q` (`ctrl+b` then `q`). Reattach: `herdr` in a terminal.

## Reading scrollback robustly

```bash
herdr pane read "$pane_id" --source recent-unwrapped --lines 80
herdr pane read "$pane_id" --source recent-unwrapped --lines 200
herdr pane read "$pane_id" --source visible --lines 50
herdr pane read "$pane_id" --source detection
```

Prefer `recent-unwrapped` for agent transcripts. Widen `--lines` stepwise if truncated.

## Broadcast pattern (manual)

Prefer `scripts/broadcast.sh` — it already resolves paths, dedupes, and rejects
busy/blocked panes. The manual equivalent below exists for when the script is
unavailable and must **replicate the same safeguards**, not skip them:

```bash
# Repo-local copies win over global installs (see Phase 2a). Fail fast if
# unresolved — do not silently continue with an empty $here.

Do **not** `agent send` and then `pane run` the same message (double submit). Do **not** wait only on `done` for the full budget when the tab is focused — agents often settle as `idle` (use `wait_for_idle.py` or idle|done polling). Do **not** drop the dedupe or busy/blocked preflight from this manual path — that would reintroduce double-sends and dialog-clobbering that `scripts/broadcast.sh` exists to prevent.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| CLI errors "server not running" | `herdr status`; user starts `herdr` once in a real TTY |
| Sub-agent on a new tab | You used `tab create` — use grid split in the root tab instead |
| Root pane taken by worker | Never `pane run` the worker CLI on `$HERDR_PANE_ID` |
| Unequal-width columns | Always split the current rightmost column and apply the full resize plan from `next_grid_split.py` |
| Agent always `unknown` | `herdr integration install <agent>`; `herdr agent explain <target>` |
| Nested tmux breaks detection | Don't run tmux inside Herdr panes |
| `pane run` typed but agent idle | Preflight (`preflight_send.py`), then guarded `send-keys $pane enter`; re-wait `working` and **propagate** its failure (a swallowed re-wait reports non-delivery as success) |
| Status stuck `working` | `pane read`; overall wait budget; escalate stall |
| `blocked` | Human must answer dialog; `agent focus` to show it |
| Panes too narrow | Fewer agents (equal-width columns shrink every time); tab-per-agent only if user asks |
| Wrong project files | Confirm `--cwd` before spawn |
| Name not found | `herdr agent list`; names are unique session-wide |
| Accidentally focused spawn | Pass `--no-focus` on `pane split` / `agent start` |

### Debug one pane

```bash
herdr pane get "$pane_id"
herdr agent explain "$pane_id"
herdr agent explain "$pane_id" --json
herdr pane process-info --pane "$pane_id"
```

### Logs

```
~/.config/herdr/herdr.log
~/.config/herdr/herdr-client.log
~/.config/herdr/herdr-server.log
HERDR_LOG=herdr=debug herdr   # human client only
```

## Mapping from tmux-agent-comms

| tmux | Herdr |
|---|---|
| `tmux split-window` from current | `next_grid_split.py` + `herdr pane split <rightmost> --direction right --no-focus` + `herdr pane resize` on every column |
| session name | agent `name` + `pane_id` |
| `tmux send-keys … Enter` | `herdr pane run` |
| `tmux capture-pane -p -S -40` | `herdr pane read … --source recent-unwrapped --lines 40` |
| `tmux has-session` | `herdr agent get` / `herdr pane get` |
| `tmux kill-pane` (worker) | `herdr pane close` (sub-agent only) |
| `tmux kill-server` | `herdr server stop` (confirm!) |
| multiple app terminal tabs | **one** tab grid: root + tiled sub-agents |
